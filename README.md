# Project 1: Battleship

### Version 1.0

This document serves as the introduction to my Battleship Project. The project is part of my deliverable at the end of Unit 1 of the SEI Bootcamp. Unit 1 focuses on vanilla JavaScript, as well as HTML and CSS. The project mandate participants to use all 3 languages to create a game that functions accordingly. Note that this version of the game serves as the foundation, upon which further upgrade packages will be implemented to enhance the features and functionalities of the game. 

In this project, I re-created the classic Battleship game. The details and rules of the game can be found below. In this version of the Battleship, it is "player vs self" style, where the computer randomly allocates the battleships and the player aims to find all the hidden ships.

Rules:
- Only the player can make an action.
- Action include clicking on the computer's board, and the aim is to find all battleships. Battleships, once hit, will be turn the grid square to red.
- If player misses, the grid square will turn black. 

Winning condition:
- Player finds all the ships.

Possible upgrades to Version 1.0 includes:
- Improved game logic to prevent the computer allocation of ship from splitting into the next row of the column.
- Allocation of ships to include vertical direction.
- Winning condition to properly account for all ships sunks.
- A losing condition where player used upo maximum number of moves.

How to run the program:
- Download the files into your local computer.
- Run VSCode and open the files "FINAL.js", "style.css" and "index.html" files there.
- Make sure Live Server extension is installed in VSCode, and click on the "Go Live" button to launch the game in a browser.

How to restart the game:
- Refresh the browser.
